# Facial Keypoint Detection Using VGG16

## Overview
This project implements a facial keypoint detection system using the VGG16 model. The system identifies key facial landmarks, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, making it applicable in various fields like facial recognition, emotion analysis, and augmented reality.

## Features
- Detects 68 facial keypoints.
- Utilizes the VGG16 architecture for feature extraction.
- Provides a user-friendly interface via a Streamlit application.

## Installation
### Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository for your use, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuRiKaPraJaPaTi/facial_keypoint-training.git
cd facial_keypoint-training
```

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Before running the model, it is recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Here are the steps:
- **Creating Virtual Environment**:
You can create a virtual environment using `venv`. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
On Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```



### Requirements File
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content and install these dependencies

```
torch
torchvision
opencv-python
numpy
streamlit
```

## Usage

### Running the App
To start the Streamlit application, run:

```bash
streamlit run demo.py
```

### Input
Upload an image containing a face, and the model will output the detected facial keypoints.

### Output
The application will display the uploaded image with the detected keypoints highlighted.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on the VGG16 architecture, consisting of:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU activations introduce non-linearity.
- **Max Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps while retaining critical information.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Map extracted features to keypoint coordinates.

### Architecture Details
- **Input Size**: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels.
- **Keypoint Output**: The model predicts 136 values (68 keypoints, each represented by x and y coordinates).

For a detailed explanation of the model architecture, training process, and parameters, please refer to [model.md](docs/model.md).
## Training
The model is trained on a dataset of facial images with corresponding keypoint annotations.

### Dataset
This project utilizes the [Kaggle Facial Keypoints Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data) for training and evaluation.
